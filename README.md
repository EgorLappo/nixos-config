### XMonad Layout

Two main details. First, `Alt-Space` switches between two versions: simple regular tiled version, and the grid layout. **However**, for single window configs, regular tiled goes full screen, while the grip layout keeps the window centered in the middle. Additionally, `Alt-f` **always** toggles full screen mode.
